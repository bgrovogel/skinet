## üö¶ **1xx: Informational responses**

These status codes indicate that the server has received the request and is processing it.

- **`100` Continue** ‚Äì The server has received the request headers, and the client should proceed to send the request body.

  - **Use Case**: Typically used for large file uploads or requests where the server needs to ensure that the client is still sending the data.

- **`101` Switching Protocols** ‚Äì The server is switching protocols as requested by the client.

  - **Use Case**: Seen in protocols like WebSockets or HTTP/2, where the client requests a protocol switch (e.g., upgrading from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2).

- **`102` Processing** ‚Äì The server has received the request and is processing it, but no response is available yet (used by WebDAV).

  - **Use Case**: Useful for long-running operations like complex calculations or querying large databases.

- **`103` Early Hints** ‚Äì Used to send preliminary headers before the final response (for performance optimizations).
  - **Use Case**: Used to begin loading resources ahead of the main response, reducing page load times.

## ‚úÖ **2xx: Successful responses**

These status codes indicate that the request was successfully received, understood, and processed by the server.

- **`200` OK** ‚Äì The request was successful, and the server returned the requested data.

  - **Use Case**: Standard response for a successful GET request, like retrieving a webpage or API data.

- **`201` Created** ‚Äì The request was successful, and a resource was created (e.g., POST request).

  - **Use Case**: Used when a client successfully creates a new resource (e.g., creating a new user account or adding a new post).

- **`202` Accepted** ‚Äì The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing is not complete.

  - **Use Case**: Often used for asynchronous operations like background jobs or delayed processing (e.g., a payment being processed after submission).

- **`203` Non-Authoritative Information** ‚Äì The server successfully processed the request, but the returned information may be from a different source.

  - **Use Case**: Used when the server responds with data that is not directly from its own resources, such as data retrieved from a third-party service.

- **`204` No Content** ‚Äì The server successfully processed the request, but there is no content to send in the response.

  - **Use Case**: Used when a request is successful but no data needs to be returned (e.g., a successful DELETE request).

- **`205` Reset Content** ‚Äì The server successfully processed the request, and the client should reset the document view.

  - **Use Case**: Used in scenarios where the client needs to reset or clear its view after a successful request (e.g., clearing a form after submitting data).

- **`206` Partial Content** ‚Äì The server is delivering only part of the resource due to a range header sent by the client.
  - **Use Case**: Used when downloading large files in parts (e.g., video streaming, breaking a file into chunks for download).

## üîÑ **3xx: Redirection messages**

These status codes indicate that the client must take some additional action to complete the request.

- **`300` Multiple Choices** ‚Äì The request has more than one possible response.

  - **Use Case**: Seen when the client must choose between multiple responses, such as a webpage with language options.

- **`301` Moved Permanently** ‚Äì The resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.

  - **Use Case**: Used when a webpage has permanently moved to a new URL (e.g., website redesign with a new URL structure).

- **`302` Found** ‚Äì The resource is temporarily available at a different URL.

  - **Use Case**: Common in web applications when a form submission triggers a redirect to a confirmation page.

- **`303` See Other** ‚Äì The response to the request can be found at another URL, using the GET method.

  - **Use Case**: After a form submission, the client should make a GET request to a different URL to fetch the result (e.g., redirects after `POST` submissions).

- **`304` Not Modified** ‚Äì The resource has not been modified since the last request.

  - **Use Case**: Used for caching purposes, when the client already has the latest version of the resource.

- **`305` Use Proxy** ‚Äì The requested resource must be accessed through a proxy.

  - **Use Case**: An outdated status code; rarely used today, but historically used to indicate that the client should use a proxy to access the resource.

- **`306` (Unused)** ‚Äì No longer used; previously reserved for future use.

  - **Use Case**: It was reserved for a future HTTP version, but it is no longer in use.

- **`307` Temporary Redirect** ‚Äì The resource has temporarily moved to a different URL (client should repeat the request to the new URL).

  - **Use Case**: Often used for temporarily moving a resource or during server maintenance, requiring the client to retry at a different location.

- **`308` Permanent Redirect** ‚Äì The resource has permanently moved to a new URL (client should update its stored URL).
  - **Use Case**: Used when a resource has permanently moved, and the client should update its URL.

  - **Use Case**: Happens when a request that contains a body (like `POST`) doesn‚Äôt include a `Content-Length` header.

- **`412` Precondition Failed** ‚Äì A precondition specified in the request (e.g., `If-Match`) failed.

  - **Use Case**: Triggered when the client‚Äôs request conditions are not met (e.g., mismatch between the entity tag in the request and the resource).

- **`413` Payload Too Large** ‚Äì The request entity is too large for the server to process.

  - **Use Case**: Happens when a client sends a file or data that exceeds the server's configured maximum size.

- **`414` URI Too Long** ‚Äì The URI provided is too long for the server to process.
